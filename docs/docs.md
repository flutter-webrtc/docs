# Getting Started

Let's discover **Flutter-WebRTC in less than 5 minutes**.

## Introduction

### What can you find in the Flutter-WebRTC community?

Flutter-WebRTC community is an open source project derived from the [dart/flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework. We packaged the [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) library into a flutter plugin to create modern WebRTC/VoIP applications that can cross all platforms.

We have developed the dart-lang version of the SIP protocol stack, so you can develop cross-platform VOIP applications in easy way.

All projects use MIT license agreement, You can use it freely in the project. If you make a profit from this project, please [sponsor this project](https://opencollective.com/flutter-webrtc).
