# Introduction

Dart SIP UA is a SIP protocol stack developed by dart-lang. You can use it to develop cross-platform VOIP applications. This project relies on the flutter-webrtc plugin, so you can get a high-quality audio and video call experience. SIP signaling uses WSS ( WebSocket Secure), all data is encrypted, you don't need to worry about eavesdropping on the call.

## Overview

- Use pure [dart-lang](https://dart.dev)
- SIP over WebSocket (use real SIP in your flutter mobile, [desktop](https://flutter.dev/desktop), [web](https://flutter.dev/web) apps)
- High-quality Audio/video calls ([flutter-webrtc](https://github.com/cloudwebrtc/flutter-webrtc)) and instant messaging
- Support with standard SIP servers such as OpenSIPS, Kamailio, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH.
- Support RFC2833 or INFO to send DTMF.

## Thanks

Thanks to the original authors of [JsSIP](https://github.com/versatica/JsSIP) for developed the JS version, which makes it possible to port the [dart-lang](https://dart.dev) version.
